    <h1>Experience</h1>
    <p>
      I spend most of my time crafting UIs using JavaScript, HTML and CSS for
      server-rendered and client-side applications. I’m highly involved in the
      platform-side of things like CSS architecture, design-system engineering
      and build processes to make developing cool stuff fast and consistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I’m not coding, I’m involved in the UX-side of things like sketching
      out wireframes and designs on paper or whiteboard, creating high-fidelity
      designs and clickable prototypes and user-testing them.
