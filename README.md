My personal website and general dumping ground to try out my ideas.

## Local Setup

You will need node.js installed to run this locally and build the files.

To get started:
- From the terminal, browse to the project's root folder 
- Run `npm install`


## Development task

Run `npm run dev`

This will:
- Builds the JS, CSS and HTML files
- Run the webpack-dev-server to see your changes
- Hot-reloads CSS and JS as changes are made

## Individual tasks

**Dev bundling with hot-reloading:** run `npm run dev`

**Production-ready bundling:** run `gulp build`
