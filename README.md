My personal website and general dumping ground to try out my ideas.

## Local Setup

You will need node.js installed to run this locally and build the files.

To get started:
- From the terminal, browse to the project's root folder 
- Run `npm install`


## Development gulp task

Run `gulp dev`

This will:
- Builds the JS, CSS and HTML files
- Run a local web-server to see you changes
- Live-reloads the browser as changes are made

## Individual gulp tasks

**Browsing locally:** run `gulp serve`

**Wipe-out built files:** run `gulp clean`

**Building all files:** run `gulp build`

**Building HTML:** run `gulp build-templates`

**Building JS:** run `gulp build-scripts`

**Building CSS:** run `gulp build-styles`
